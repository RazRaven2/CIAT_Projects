      <h1>The School of Athens</h1>
      <h2>By Raphael</h2>
      <img src="code2-3_img.png" alt="School of Athens" />
      <p>The <em>School of Athens</em>, considered by many to be Raphael's
         masterwork, is a fresco representing the greatest minds of
         classical antiquity, gathered together to share their 
         thoughts and beliefs. The fresco was painted between 1509 and 1511
         as a part of a commission to decorate the rooms of the 
         Stanze di Raffaello in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.</p>
      <p>The two center figures, Aristotle and Plato, are key philosophers
         in the development of Western thought. Plato, with his belief in a
         higher realty, points skyward. Within his hands, Plato holds 
         the <cite>Timaeus</cite> &mdash; one of Plato's famous dialogs on
         the nature of reality and time. In contrast, Aristotle points 
         downward, indicating that he is grounded in a reality that can be
         experienced by sight and touch. In his hands, he holds his
         book <cite>Ethics</cite>, a tome that emphasizes the need for
         justice, friendship, and ethical government.
      </p>
      <p>Other famous philosophers fill the pseudo-architecture. In many cases,
         when Raphael did not have classical images to draw upon, he used
         images of contemporary figures to stand in for their classical
         counterparts. Look for a portrait of Michelangelo on the left-forward
         steps, his thoughts concerned with sketching and art.</p>
