   <h1>Literary Excerpts</h1>
   <h2>A Selection of Great Prose</h2>
   <blockquote>
      We are the music-makers, And we are the dreamers of dreams, Wandering 
      by lone sea-breakers, And sitting by desolate streams. World-losers and 
      world-forsakers, Upon whom the pale moon gleams; Yet we are the movers 
      and shakers, Of the world forever, it seems.<br />
      &mdash; <cite>Arthur O’Shaughnessy, Poems of Arthur O’Shaughnessy</cite>
   </blockquote>  
   <blockquote>
      I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. 
      I am, I am, I am.<br />
      &mdash; <cite>Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar</cite>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
      The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they 
      are felt with the heart.<br />
      &mdash; <cite>Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, The Little Prince</cite>
   </blockquote>   
   <blockquote>
      Stuff your eyes with wonder, he said, live as if you’d drop dead in ten 
      seconds. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream made 
      or paid for in factories.<br />
      &mdash; <cite>Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</cite>
