      <p>Welcome to the Sci-Fi Control Room</p>
      <p>I started this blog in order to share my latest fiction with my 
         readers and to post reviews and comments on the world of Science Fiction 
         and Fantasy. From time to time, we'll have interviews with other 
         great authors in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy markets as well as give you 
         the inside scoop on upcoming conventions.</p>
      <p>But this is also your forum to share your ideas and enthusiasm. 
         You can send me your comments and ideas; but please do NOT send me your 
         fiction. I'm not a publisher and I will NOT read them. This is the 
         Sci-Fi Control Room and I'm the one in control.</p>

      <h1>The Star Tunnel</h1>
      <h2>by Kei Yang</h2>
      <p>In her latest science-fiction novel, Yang explores the idea of 
         quantum tunneling and a machine built to instantly transport the rider 
         to the end of the universe. Teleportation is an old sci-fi concept and 
         one that I thought had been wrung dry. Yang has proven me wrong. 
         Reminiscent of the best of Niven's teleportation series stories from 
         the 70's, Yang is concerned, not so much with the technology of teleportation, 
         as much as its effect on society, morals, and religion.</p>
      <p>To be sure, this is not just philosophical track masquerading as a 
         SF novel (though Yang's always-fascinating philosophical ruminations are 
         here in abundance). Fans of hard-hitting action-packed SF will have plenty 
         to entertain them and Yang pulls several rabbits out of her hat to 
         surprise any reader. I thought I knew all of the tricks of the trade 
         and Yang's denouement surprised even me.</p>
      <p>My only complaint is that the novel begins slowly with a bit too much 
         emphasis on the technobabble associated with teleportation. Why do some 
         authors insist on turning whole chapters into a physics thesis? However 
         don't skip the second chapter or else you'll miss a hilarious misadventure 
         involving two teleportation devices and a rather annoying cat. </p>
