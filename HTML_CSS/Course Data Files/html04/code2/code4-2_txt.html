      <h1>Dawn</h1>
      <h2>by Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h2>      
      <p>Day's sweetest moments are at dawn;<br />
      Refreshed by his long sleep, the Light<br />
      Kisses the languid lips of Night,<br />
      Ere she can rise and hasten on.<br />
      All glowing from his dreamless rest<br />
      He holds her closely to his breast,<br />
      Warm lip to lip and limb to limb,<br />
      Until she dies for love of him.</p>
