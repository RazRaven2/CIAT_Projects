      <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br />
         Admit impediments. Love is not love<br /> 
         Which alters when it alteration finds,<br /> 
         Or bends with the remover to remove.</p> 
      <p>O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br /> 
         That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br /> 
         It is the star to every wand'ring bark,<br /> 
         Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p> 
      <p>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br /> 
         Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br /> 
         Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br /> 
         But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p> 
      <p>If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br /> 
         I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd. </p>
