<h1>The Statement of Randolph Carter</h1>
<h2>by H.P. Lovecraft</h2>

<p>I REPEAT to you gentlemen, that your inquisition is
fruitless. Detain me here <span>for ever</span> if you will;
confine or execute me if you must have a victim to propitiate the illusion you
call justice; but I can say no more than I have said already. Everything that I
can remember, I have told with perfect candor. Nothing has been distorted or
concealed, and if anything remains vague, it is only because of the dark cloud
which has come over my mind, that cloud and the nebulous nature of the horrors
which brought it upon me.</p>

<p><span>Again</span> I say, I do not know what has
become of Harley Warren, though I think, almost hope, that he is in peaceful
oblivion, if there be anywhere so blessed a thing. It is true that I have for
five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible <span
>researches</span> into the unknown. I will not deny, though my
memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us
together as he says, on the <span>Gainsville</span> pike, walking
toward Big Cypress Swamp, at half past eleven on that awful night. That we bore
electric lanterns, spades, and a curious coil of wire with attached
instruments, I will even affirm; for these things all played a part in the
single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection. But of
what followed, and of the reason I was found alone and dazed on the edge of the
swamp next morning, I must insist that I know nothing save what I have told you
<span>over and over again</span>. You say to me that there is
nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful
episode. I reply that I knew nothing beyond what I saw. Vision or nightmare it
may have been, vision or nightmare I fervently hope it was, yet it is all that my
mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the sight
of men. And why Harley Warren did not return, he or his shade, or some nameless
thing I cannot describe, alone can tell.</p>

<p>As I have said before, the weird studies of Harley Warren
were well known to me, and to some extent shared by me. Of his vast collection
of strange, rare books on forbidden subjects I have read all that are written
in the languages of which I am master; but these are few as compared with those
in languages I cannot understand. Most, I believe, are in Arabic; and the
fiend-inspired book which brought on the end, the book which he carried in his
pocket out of the world, was written in characters <span>whose</span>
like I never saw elsewhere. Warren would never tell me just what was in that
book. As to the nature of our studies, must I say again that I no longer retain
full comprehension? It seems to me rather merciful that I do not, for they were
terrible studies, which I pursued more through reluctant fascination than
through actual inclination. Warren always dominated me, and sometimes I feared
him. I remember how I shuddered at his facial expression on the night before
the awful happening, when he talked so incessantly of his theory, why certain
corpses never decay, but rest firm and fat in their tombs for a thousand years.
But I do not fear him now, for I suspect that he has known horrors beyond my
ken. Now I fear for him.</p>

<p>Once more I say that I have no clear idea of our object on
that night. Certainly, it had much to do with something in the book which
Warren carried with him, that ancient book in undecipherable characters which
had come to him from India a month before, but I swear I do not know what it was
that we expected to find. Your witness says he saw us at half past eleven on
the <span>Gainsville</span> pike, headed for Big Cypress Swamp.
This is probably true, but I have no distinct memory of it. The picture seared
into my soul is of one scene only, and the hour must have been long after
midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the vaporous heavens.</p>

<p>The place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I
trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp
hollow, overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled
with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone.
On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted
by the notion that Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a
lethal silence of centuries. Over the valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon
peered through the noisome vapors that seemed to emanate from unheard of
catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent
array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausoleum facades; all crumbling,
moss-grown, and moisture-stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance
of the unhealthy vegetation.</p>
