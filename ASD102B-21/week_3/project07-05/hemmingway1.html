<h1>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</h1>
<h2>by Ernest Hemingway</h2>
<p>Francis Macomber had, half an hour before, been carried to
his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the
cook, the personal boys, the skinner and the porters.
The gun-bearers had taken no part in the demonstration. When the native boys
put him down at the door of his tent, he had shaken all their hands, received
their congratulations, and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his
wife came in.</p>
<p>She did not speak to him when she came in and he left the tent at
once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over
to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze and the
shade.</p>

<p>"You've got your lion," Robert Wilson said to him, "and a
damned fine one too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Macomber looked at Wilson quickly. She was an extremely
handsome and well kept woman
of the beauty and social position which had, five years before, commanded five
thousand dollars as the price of endorsing, with photographs, a beauty product
which she had never used. She had been married to Francis Macomber for eleven
years.</p>

<p>"He is a good lion, isn't he?" Macomber said. His wife
looked at him now. She looked at both these men as though she had never seen
them before.</p>

<p>One, Wilson, the white hunter, she knew she had never truly
seen before. He was about middle height with sandy hair, a stubby mustache, a
very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white
wrinkles at the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled. He smiled at her
now and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the
loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the left
breast pocket should have been, at his big brown hands, his old slacks, his
very dirty boots and back to his red face again. She noticed where the baked
red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his
Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole.</p>

<p>"Well, here's to the lion," Robert Wilson said. He smiled at
her again and, not smiling, she looked curiously at
her husband.</p>

<p>Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did
not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather
thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of
safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new, he was thirty-five
years old, kept himself very fit, was good at court games, had a number of big-game fishing records, and had just shown
himself, very publicly, to be a coward. </p>

<p>"Here's to the lion," he said. "I can't ever thank you for
what you did." </p>

<p>Margaret, his wife, looked away from him and back to Wilson.
"Let's not talk about the lion," she said. </p>

<p>Wilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled
at him. "It's been a very strange day," she said. "Hadn't you ought to put your
hat on even under the canvas at noon? You told me that, you know." </p>

<p>"Might put it on," said Wilson.</p>

<p>"You know you have a
very red face, Mr. Wilson," she told him and smiled again. </p>

<p>"Drink," said Wilson. </p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said. "Francis drinks a great deal,
but his face is never red." </p>

<p>"It's red today," Macomber tried a joke. "</p>

<p>No," said Margaret. "It's mine that's red today. But Mr.
Wilson's is always red." "Must be racial," said Wilson. "I say, you wouldn't
like to drop my beauty as a topic, would you?" </p>

<p>"I've just started on it." "Let's chuck it," said Wilson.
"Conversation is going to be so difficult," Margaret said. "</p>

<p>Don't be silly, Margot," her husband said. </p>

<p>"No difficulty," Wilson said. "Got a damn fine lion." </p>

<p>Margot looked at them both and they both saw that she was
going to cry. Wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it.
Macomber was past dreading it. "I wish it hadn't happened. Oh, I wish it hadn't
happened," she said and started for her tent. She made no noise of crying but they could see that her shoulders were shaking
under the rose-colored, sun-proofed shirt she wore. </p>

<p>"Women upset," said Wilson to the tall man. "Amounts to
nothing. Strain on the nerves and one thing'n
another." </p>

<p>"No," said Macomber. "I suppose that I rate that for the
rest of my life now." </p>

<p>"Nonsense. Let's have a spot of the
giant killer," said Wilson. "Forget the whole thing. Nothing to it anyway." </p>

<p>"We might try," said Macomber. </p>

<p>"I won't forget what you did for me though." </p>

<p>"Nothing," said Wilson. "All nonsense."</p>
