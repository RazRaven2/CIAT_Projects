            shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.
         </p>
         <p>4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the 
            principal officers of the executive departments or of such other 
            body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President 
            pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 
            Representatives their written declaration that the President is
            unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the 
            Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of 
            the office as Acting President.
         </p>
         <p>Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro 
            tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 
            Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, 
            he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the 
            Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of
            the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by 
            law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro 
            tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 
            Representatives their written declaration that the President is 
            unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon
            Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty eight 
            hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within 
            twenty one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, 
            or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty one days after 
            Congress is required to assemble, determines by two thirds vote 
            of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the
            powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue 
            to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President 
            shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
