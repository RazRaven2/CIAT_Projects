Reversing a Word
For this first example of using a stack, we examine a simple task: reversing a word. When you run the program, you type in a word or phrase, and the program displays the reversed version.

A stack is used to reverse the letters. 
First, the characters are extracted one by one from the input string and pushed onto the stack. 
Then theyâ€™re popped off the stack and displayed. Because of its last-in, first-out characteristic, 
the stack reverses the order of the characters. 
Example:
Word to reverse: draw
The reverse of draw is ward
